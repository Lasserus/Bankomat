# ATM
ATM machine that allows users to deposit and withdraw money from their bank acount. To acces your account you need pin code. You have 3 tries and then you are locked out of ATM. 

For writting the code i used Python and his library Tkinter for GUI. It has local database in which all the pins and info about balance are stored. For that i used SQLite. 

The biggest achievements of working on this project are learning Tkinter and better understanding of OOP. It was interesting and fun to realize an idea I had for a long time
